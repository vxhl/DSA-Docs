// Problem Statement -- 
// Find the minimum number of multiplications needed to mulitply a sequence of matrices
// logic : This is a dynamic programming problem last time we applied memoisation
// which had a time compexity of O(N^3) and followed the recurssion approach
// Tabulation also has same time complexity but uses iteration instead of recurssion 
// So much more efficient
