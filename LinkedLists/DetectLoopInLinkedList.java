/*
Problem Statement:
Given a linkedlist of N nodes. Check if it has a loop
Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
x = 2
Output: True
Explanation: In above test case N = 3.
The linked list with nodes N = 3 is
given. Then value of x=2 is given which
means last node is connected with xth
node of linked list. Therefore, there
exists a loop.
